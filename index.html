            <p> MoMo is an american shorthair tabby. She is an indoor cat who prefers toys that remian
                on the ground. She has been a lazy, adorable lap cat for about 8 years. MoMo has lived in towns all over Washington, but her first major move was from Sammamish Washington to Ellensburg to attend Central Washington University where she majored in sleep studies. She was such an excellent student they awarded her with a PhD in her first quarter, and she chose to move into research full time after graduation. Momo now spends most of her time researching sleep in her new home by testing how her sleep changes from the bed, to couch, to desk chairs.
